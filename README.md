# Gait-events-identification-algorithm
A python algorithm to detect foot contact and foot clearance using kinematic or inertial data during forward or backward walking.

This git includes a seperate algorithm for FW and BW event calculation, as well as examples of data files (for kinematic and IMU data).

If you find this helpful, please leave a comment, and / or cite the paper:

Also please don't hesistate to reach out for any questions regarding the algorithm.
